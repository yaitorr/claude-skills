# Strategy Document Revision Skill
This skill ensures that revisions to a strategy document are consistent and adhering to personal standards

## Revision policies
When revising, please consider the following:
1. Revisions should be aligned with the book "Good Strategy, Bad Strategy" by Richard Rumelt.
2. If the original draft deviates, make sure to raise that as part of the feedback included with the revision.

## Revision Standards

### Template
The revision should have 4 main parts (in order)
1. Executive summary: summarizes the whole document and its parts. This section will always be missing from the original draft. Summarize the draft and provide.
2. Problem Statement: communicates the problem effectively, and ends with one or two questions that lead into the next part
3. Strategic Principles: a series of policies that leading into action
4. Recommended Actions: actionable set that complies with at least one strategic principle

### Formatting
1. The output should always include a markdown document
2. Headers
   1. Level 1 (`#`) for main parts
   2. Level 2 (`##`) for sub-sections within main parts

### Reference
