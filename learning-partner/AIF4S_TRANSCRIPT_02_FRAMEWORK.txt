The 4Ds: A Summary of the AI Fluency Framework 
You’ve probably tried AI — maybe to help with an essay, solve a problem, or just explore what it can do. You’ve probably even found a few applications you really love and work with often. But there’s a difference between using AI and being fluent with it. 
In this video, we'll explore AI fluency - using AI effectively, efficiently, ethically and safely. We're talking about skills that go beyond any specific tool or clever prompt—skills that lead to genuine mastery that will serve you whether you're working with today's AI or whatever comes next.
We’ll walk through the “4D” framework — four competencies that we hope will transform how you work with AI. Whether you’re gathering information, collaborating on projects, or even setting up AI systems to work independently on our behalf, these skills will make you more effective.
This video provides just a high-level overview of the framework, and we encourage you to explore the richer insights and exercises for each competency available in our AI Fluency Framework & Foundations course, which is linked in this lesson page. 
At it’s core, AI fluency is about being a responsible human in the loop. Which means making decisions and using AI responsibly. It’s about augmenting, or adding to, the great work you already do. This is in contrast to simple automation, where people ask AI to do work for them without thinking deeply about what they’re asking, or what the impact might be. This is especially important in learning, where we really don’t want AI to do work for us. Instead we want AI to help us do our work better.
The 4Ds are Delegation, Description, Discernment, and Diligence. Think of them as four interconnected competencies that, when combined, create AI fluency. 
Let's begin with Delegation—basically figuring out what we are trying to do and who should do it. Delegation asks: What work should humans do, what should AI do, and what should we do together? Simple, right? But splitting up the work effectively is the foundation of thoughtful AI collaboration.
Effective delegation requires three types of awareness:
First, Problem Awareness. Before you even pull up an AI assistant, get clear on what you’re actually trying to do. Studying for a test? Sure, but what do you need to do? Review vocabulary? Prepare for case studies? What does success look like? The clearer you are about your goals at the outset, the easier it is to stay true to your original intention as you work with AI. Occasionally, you may revise your problem awareness during the course of AI collaboration, but it should exist as your north star as you work with AI. Your understanding of the problem is the foundation of fluent AI use.
Second, Platform Awareness. Not all AI is the same. Different AI systems have different capabilities and limitations. Some are great at complex reasoning, some are custom-built to aid student learning. If problem awareness tells us the job that needs doing, platform awareness helps us find the best tool or partner to get the job done. It’s like choosing how to get to class, you might walk, bike, bus, or drive, it all depends on your specific circumstances. . 
Finally, there’s Task Delegation. Task delegation is where you actually divide the work between yourself and AI to leverage the strengths of each. Us humans bring creativity, judgment, and real world context. AI offers speed, consistency, and the ability to process vast amounts of information. The best results happen when we play to both strengths
Next, let’s look at Description.
Description is how you actually talk to AI. But it’s more than just prompting, it recognizes that working with AI fluently is more like having a conversation with a collaborator, not memorizing perfect prompts or giving commands.
Consider these three dimensions of description:
Product Description is about what you want from the final result. The more detail the better. Don’t just say “I need to write an email” specify how long it should be, the key messages, who the email is going to, what style should the writing be in, and so on. the outputs, format, intended audience, and style of the final product itself. 
Process Description is about how the AI should approach your request. Imagine you’re teaching another person how to do the task—whatever you’d say to them is what you might consider saying to the AI assistant. For example, you might ask the AI to "think step-by-step," "consider multiple perspectives," or "start with the most important points." This helps guide AI's thinking process for a final result that is more aligned to your vision.
Finally, Performance Description defines how you want AI to behave during your interaction. Need a critical editor who challenges your ideas? Say so. Want supportive brainstorming? Ask for it! You shape how your AI assistant responds. 
While Description is about explaining what we want, Discernment is about our ability to recognize a good or bad result. It involves having good judgement about what AI produces and knowing how to adapt and adjust accordingly.
Good discernment protects against errors and might even allow you to explore new creative ways to accomplish your goals with AI’s help. Like Description, it works on three levels: product, process, and performance.
Product Discernment evaluates the quality of what the AI creates. Is the information accurate? Do the suggestions actually help? But also—did the AI show you something you hadn’t considered? This is both about checking for factual inaccuracies, as well as opening up your thinking to new perspectives, much like you would when working with a friend.
Process Discernment examines how the AI got there. Did it consider all relevant factors? Make reasonable assumptions? Follow logical steps? Understanding the AI's reasoning can help you trust good outputs and spot problems.
Performance Discernment is about how the AI behaved during your interaction. Was it helpful in the way you needed? Did it stay in the role you asked for? Push back when appropriate? This awareness helps you adjust future interactions.
Remember: Good discernment is not just hunting for errors. It’s also recognizing when the AI surprises you or genuinely helps you think better. Sometimes AI suggests approaches you hadn't considered, makes connections you missed, or frames ideas in illuminating ways. 
As we mentioned before, Description and Discernment work together in a continuous feedback loop. You describe what you want, discern what you get, then adjust and refine your description. It's like any good conversation—you build understanding together. This iterative process is where real AI fluency develops.
Each round of conversation deepens the collaboration. What starts as “help me think through some ideas I have  for my essay” evolves into nuanced thinking about structure, arguments, and evidence. This loop transforms AI from a tool that follows instructions into a partner that helps you think and achieve your goals better.
Last but not least, let’s talk about Diligence. Diligence is about taking responsibility for how we use AI, and it is important at every stage of AI collaboration. Diligence ensures AI use remains responsible, transparent, and ethical. This isn't some boring compliance thing. It's about using AI in ways you can feel good about and stand behind. 
First is Creation Diligence, which involves thoughtfully selecting which AI systems we use and how we interact with them. When picking an AI assistant, consider privacy, security, and appropriateness for your specific context. Using AI for personal brainstorming? Cool. Using it for complex analysis? Also great. But different situations call for different approaches.
Next is Transparency Diligence, which means  being honest about how you worked with AI. Your professors, teammates, and future employers deserve to know when AI helped you and how. Done right, you have nothing to hide— in fact you're showcasing your ability to collaborate with AI fluently which has become a critical professional skill.
Finally, there’s Deployment Diligence which means taking ownership of what we create with AI. We verify accuracy, ensure appropriateness, and take responsibility for what we put out into the world. AI might draft the email, but you send it. AI might suggest ideas, but you choose which to use. We're always responsible for the final result.
The 4Ds really come alive when you use them together — and like anything, they improve with practice. You may be watching this video as a part of an online course, in school, or for your own learning, but trying it out in practice is where you’ll likely really start understanding what we mean and how the 4Ds can change how you work with AI.
Each time you thoughtfully delegate work, carefully and clearly describe your needs, critically evaluate and discern outputs, and diligently take responsibility for the results, your fluency grows. 
Our hope is that the 4Ds remain relevant even as AI technology evolves. New capabilities will come, but the need for strategic thinking, clear communication, critical evaluation, and ethical responsibility will endure.
Start practicing with your next AI interaction. Notice which D you're using. Try being more intentional about each one. You'll be surprised how quickly your AI collaborations improve.
That's the framework—now go make it yours!
